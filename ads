Link (by SnackTools)

Once the banner is published, you get a free permanent link to it (optionally private). The link will be available indefinitely and can be used to preview the banner or to share it with other people without posting it in a blog or website. We do not submit these links to Google or other search engines meaning that unless you make it public it won't reach anyone.

Download

This option allows you to download banners as GIF, PNG, JPG or SWF files to host and/or use them locally. The SWF format fully supports interactivity and transitions, while GIF supports only multiple slides (without transitions and interactivity). PNG and JPG are only for static banners (first slide) and do not support any transitions or interactivity.

Embed codes

Embed codes contain a standard html script that allow you to include banners in any web page that accepts html code input without hosting them on your server.

Remove published banners

A published banner can be removed from your publishing history list by simply deleting the item from the "My banners".

ClickTag

The ClickTag variable is the industry standard for linking Flash banners to external URLs. You can use it to define the destination URL for your banners by adding a valid URL (e.g. http://www.bannersnack.com).
